		<p>COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS: Developer respects the rights of all copyright holders and in this regard Developer has adopted and implemented a policy that provides for notification and removal of content that allegedly infringes the rights of copyright holders. If you believe that your work has been copied at the Website in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide the following information required by the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. §512 (“DMCA”): </p>

		<p>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; Identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that website; Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party; A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. </p>

		<p>A user who has material disabled or removed and believes that this material is in fact covered by "Fair Use" or is in some other way not infringing, and is not in violation of the requirements of the DMCA, may provide a "counter notice." A proper "counter-notice" must provide the following: </p>

		<p>The poster's name, address, phone number, and physical or electronic signature; Identification of the material and its location before removal; statement under penalty of perjury that the material was removed in error or by misidentification; and Consent to federal court jurisdiction for adjudication of the matter, or if overseas, to an appropriate judicial body. </p>

		<p>This counter-claim notice will be promptly forwarded to the complaining party. Should a proper counter-notice be provided, Developer may restore, at its sole discretion, the alleged infringing material in 14 days unless the claiming copyright holder brings suit within that time in a federal district court. Please note that under the same law any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees. Repeat offenders may have their access to the Website terminated without notice.
